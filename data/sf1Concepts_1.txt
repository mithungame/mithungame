warehouse, is a cluster of compute resources 
size x small  to 6x 

Gotcha:
1. Increasing the size of a warehouse does not always improve "data loading" performance.

Snowpark workloads can be run on both Standard and Snowpark-optimized warehouses. Snowpark-optimized warehouses are recommended for workloads that have large memory requirements such as ML training use cases
#?#box#calculatedX@560#calculatedY@189#children@#name@3:SuspendAndResume#id@1704786661708#parent@#x@448#y@151
Auto-suspend and auto-resume apply to "entire" warehouse and not to the individual clusters in the warehouse.

For a multi-cluster warehouse:

Auto-suspend only occurs when the minimum number of clusters is running and there is no activity for the specified period of time. The minimum is typically 1 (cluster), but could be more than 1.

Auto-resume only applies when the entire warehouse is suspended (i.e. no clusters are running).

A multi-cluster warehouse is defined by specifying the following properties:

Maximum number of clusters, greater than 1 (up to 10).

Minimum number of clusters, equal to or less than the maximum (up to 10).

improve overall warehouse performance by reducing the impact of outlier queries
offloading portions of the query processing work to shared compute resources

examples = basically scenarios where parallelism can improve performance
Ad hoc analytics, unpredictable data volume per query, large scans and selective filters.

OVERALL CANDIDATES - Large Scan few selections

There are not enough partitions. If there are not enough partitions to scan, the benefits of query acceleration are offset by the latency in acquiring resources for the query acceleration service.

The query does not filter or aggregate.

The filters are not selective enough. Alternatively, the GROUP BY expression has a high cardinality.

The query includes a LIMIT clause but does not have an ORDER BY clause.

The query includes functions that return nondeterministic results (for example, SEQ or RANDOM).

#?#box#calculatedX@489#calculatedY@378#children@#name@2:zeroclone#id@1713612732#parent@#x@391#y@302
clone utilizes --- because it shares all the existing micro-partitions of the original table at the time it was cloned
no data storage
rows can then be added, deleted, or updated in the clone --- from the original table
independently
Each change to the clone results in --- that are owned exclusively by the clone and are protected through CDP.
new micro-partitions
clones can be cloned, with no limitations which results in a n-level hierarchy of cloned objects each with their own portion of shared and independent data storage

#?#box#calculatedX@337#calculatedY@313#children@#name@2:temporary#id@1713613124#parent@#x@269#y@250
Temporary tables only exist within the session
you can create temporary and non-temporary tables with the same name within the same schema.
temporary table takes precedence in the session over any other table with the same name in the same schema.

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE mytemptable (id NUMBER, creation_date DATE);
Time travel 0 or 1 ( default )
fail safe 0
#?#box#calculatedX@337#calculatedY@313#children@#name@2:transient#id@1713613125#parent@#x@269#y@250
Transient tables are similar to permanent tables with the key difference that they do not have a Fail-safe period

CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE mytranstable (id NUMBER, creation_date DATE);
Time travel 0 or 1 ( default )
fail safe 0
#?#box#calculatedX@337#calculatedY@313#children@#name@3:permanent#id@1713613126#parent@#x@269#y@250

A materialized view can query only a single table.
Joins, including self-joins, are not supported.
A materialized view cannot include UDF,Window,HAVING,ORDER BY,LIMIT , many aggregate function ETC 
#?#box#calculatedX@337#calculatedY@313#children@#name@2:gotcha#id@1716306160#parent@#x@269#y@250
materialized view can be secure
supports clustering on materialized view 
can be suspended 
add column to base table does not reflect automatically 
update or drop column - recreate materialized view 
without specifying a materialized view in a SQL statement query optimizer can automatically rewrite queries against the base table or regular views to use the materialized view instead.

Secure Data Sharing lets you share selected objects in a database in your account with other Snowflake accounts
All database objects shared between accounts are read-only
no actual data is copied or transferred between accounts
does not take up any storage in a consumer account
The only charges to consumers are for the compute resources (i.e. virtual warehouses) used to query the shared data.

The provider can share data from multiple databases in same account 
On the consumer side, a read-only database is created from the share

You can share the following Snowflake objects:
Databases
Tables
Dynamic tables
External tables
Iceberg tables
Secure views
Secure materialized views
Secure user-defined functions (UDFs)

You can share data in Snowflake using one of the following options:

a Listing, in which you offer a share and additional metadata as a data product to one or more accounts,
a Direct Share, in which you directly share specific database objects (a share) to another account in your region,
a Data Exchange, in which you set up and manage a group of accounts and offer a share to that group
