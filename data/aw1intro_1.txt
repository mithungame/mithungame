#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@AvailabilityZones#id@1719923360#parent@#x@161#y@203
An AWS Region is a physical location where we cluster data centers, known as Availability Zones.
Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, with redundant power, networking, and connectivity

#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@1719923521,1719923810#name@subnet#id@1719923445#parent@#x@161#y@203
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC

#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@types#id@1719923521#parent@#x@161#y@203
Public subnet – The subnet has a direct route to an ~*internet gateway~*
Private subnet – The subnet does not have a ~*direct route~* to an internet gateway. 
  private subnet contacs a ~*NAT device~* on ~*public subnet~* to access the public internet.
  NAT device replaces the source IPv4 address with address of the NAT device. 
  When sending response traffic to the instances, the NAT device translates the addresses back to the original source IPv4 addresses.
VPN-only subnet – The subnet has a route to a Site-to-Site VPN connection through a virtual private gateway. 
  The subnet does not have a ~*route to internet gateway~*.
  Although the term VPN connection is a general term,here it refers to the connection between your ~*VPC~* and ~*your own on-premises network~*
Isolated subnet – The subnet has no routes to destinations ~*outside VPC~*. 
  Resources in an isolated subnet can only access or be accessed by other resources in the same VPC.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html
Security groups acts as ~*virtual firewall~* that allow inbound and outbound traffic for associated resources, such as EC2 instances.
security group can be attached to ~*vpc~*, or ~*per instance level~* as ~*ec2 rds~*
you still need to open the firewall port on the actual machine itself, SG just is a control mechanism
Security groups are ~*stateful~*. 
For example, if you send a request from an instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to reach the instance regardless of the inbound security group rules. 
Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to leave the instance, regardless of the outbound rules
You can specify the ~*source~*/~*destination~*, ~*port range~*, and ~*protocol~* for each inbound/outbound rule

SUBNET A 
INBOUND 
198.1.0.0/24  TCP 22     <--- TCP 22 means ~*ssh connection~* , it allows inbound from specific address range 
subnet A CIDR All All    <--- with in subnet A allow inbound from any port and protocol 

OUTBOUND
0.0.0.0/0    All All     <--- allows all traffic

NACL ~*Network control access list~*
Every subnet that you create is automatically associated with the default network ACL for the VPC
default network ACL allows ~*all inbound and outbound~* traffic
Network ACLs allow or deny inbound and outbound traffic at the ~*subnet level~*.
In most cases, ~*security groups~* can meet your needs.

#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@internetGateway#id@1720962322#parent@#x@161#y@203
control all access to outside world
If i block internet only way to reach VPC is via VPC connection

#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@routeTable#id@1720962387#parent@#x@161#y@203
control Outgoing access
can block outgoing traffic at subnet  level
which in turn means VPC level
wont let you reach internet gateway

#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@natGateway#id@1720962434#parent@#x@161#y@203
I can forward your traffic but you still dont get public IP
Why do i need this ? say you are a database and you are in private
        and you want to access internet for a patch
but still outside world cannot access the database

Hey Route table , I am a database , though i dont need public to reach me , i need to reach internet for patching
I will point you to NAT - Network address translator

#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@instanceProfile#id@1720903805#parent@#x@161#y@203
An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts.

If you use the AWS Management Console(not command line) to create a role for Amazon EC2, the console automatically creates an instance profile and gives it the same name as the role
The console does not create an instance profile for a role that is not associated with Amazon EC2

#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@1720965151,1720965174,1720965197#name@lambda#id@1720965089#parent@#x@161#y@203
functions are executed in ~*container~* which is a ~*isolated environment~* implemented by kernel , this is known as ~*serverless~*
main properties of lambda functions are ~*maximum memory size~* , ~*timeout~* , ~*IAM Role~*
we cannot choose ~*cpu power~* in lambda , it is allocated propotional to ~*memory~*...
eg:256 mb allocates twice cpu power as 128mb
 
#?#box#calculatedX@161#calculatedY@203#children@#name@billing#id@1720965151#parent@#x@161#y@203
how is billing done in aws lambda
~*no of invocations~* and  ~*hundreds of milliseconds of execution time~*
in a 400 000 seconds and 1 gb memory package if 1gb/8 = 128mb memory is used then we get ~*400 000 seconds * 8~* = ~*3.2 million seconds~*
- qao:
 do something and return resultwhat type of function is this
 synchronous functions or RequestResponse invocations
 what is the opposite
 ' asynchronous functions or event invocation or stateless functionslike javascript'

execute help lambda cli
aws lambda invoke --function-name <function name> --payload ''<json>'' <local output file> 
    in windows payload event becomes "{""name"":""json""}"  , double quotes need two double quotes inside json
lambda can be called in different ~*region~* that its configuration use ~*--region <region name >~* specifically
aws lambda invoke help -- for help

aws cli can be of ~*different language~* than lambda function,because cli calls ~*lambda api ( its an api so any language can be used ) ~*
~*aws sdk~* can also be used to call lambda functions

Amazon ~*Simple Storage Service~* (Amazon S3) is an object storage service 
A ~*bucket~* is a container for ~*objects~*.
An object is a ~*file~* and its ~*metadata~*
Objects in a Region ~*never leave~* unless explicitly transfer or replicate to another Region.
An object key uniquely identify object within a ~*bucket~*. ~*bucket + key + version~* == object itself.
read-after-write consistency - Updates to a ~*single key~* are atomic.PUT to existing key from one thread and GET on same key from second thread ~*concurrently~*, will get ~*old/new data~*, never ~*partial/corrupt~* data.
S3 does not support object locking for ~*concurrent writers~*. If two PUT requests are simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the ~*latest timestamp~* wins
S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within AWS data centers.If a PUT request is successful(GET or LIST request)  following successful PUT will return the data written by the PUT. Note: its about ~*object not bucket~*
Bucket(~*not object~*) configurations have an ~*eventual consistency model~*. ex deleted bucket might still appear in list for some time delay,eg 2: versioning

Server-side
SSE - ~* S3 ~*
Amazon S3 managed keys - default 
SSE - ~* KMS ~*
AWS Key Management Service - have more control over your keys. view separate keys, edit control policies, and follow the keys in AWS CloudTrail. Additionally, you can create and manage ~*customer managed keys~* or use ~*AWS managed keys~* that are ~*unique to you~*
~* DSSE-KMS ~*
Dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys  - similar to SSE-KMS, but DSSE-KMS applies two individual layers of object-level encryption instead of one layer
SSE - ~*C~*
customer-provided keys  - you manage the encryption keys, and Amazon S3 manages the encryption as it writes to disks and the decryption when you access your objects

Client-side encryption – You encrypt your data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, encryption keys, and related tools.
